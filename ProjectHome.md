# pyLatinam #

PyLatinam is a Python module that processes Latin language words. This includes, for time being, declension and conjugation (morphology), with plans to upgrade code to support more processing, even on syntactic level.

The project reflects my interest in language, natural language processing and programming. However, I am not professional programmer nor I know Latin language well.

API documentation is [hosted here](http://latin.languagebits.com/api/). It's not cleaned up, though.


## Current version: 0.1.9 ##

New version is here: [pylatinam-0.1.9.rar](http://pylatinam.googlecode.com/files/pylatinam-0.1.9.rar). It brings improvements in declension.

## Latest updates ##

The HTML interface for the project is created. Now all those who would like to try the program have no need to download and install Python and the pyLatinam code. Visit [web version of pyLatinam](http://latin.languagebits.com/interactive/index.py) and see how the stuff work and how mature (or not) the project is.

You can visit the [FAQ](http://latin.languagebits.com/interactive/faq.py?lng=en) page to learn more.

## About current version ##

The link on the right side ("Featured download") points to the current download version. [The latest code changes](http://latin.languagebits.com/wiki/) are available on the wiki pages. Most of the recent changes will find their place in upcoming releases.

## Upcoming major release (one day) ##

In the new major version some core elements will be changed, including recognition of noun declension and introduction of full-scale database (sqlite3) for lexicon/dictionary. The changes will bring loads of new stuff for online version.

## Current status ##

I am working very little, if anything, on this project - due to the academic work in another field (phonetics). I hope to be able to update the code from time to time.
