= Introduction =

PyLatinam is Python module that deals with linguistic processing of Latin language words. This includes for time being declension and conjugation (morphology), with plans to upgrade code to support more processing, even on syntactic level.


= Modules =

These are modules in pyLatinam:
  
==Module *lexicon*==
This module searches lexicon and dictionary files for entries. The search is preformed in very simple manner: text search line by 
line.

==Module *morph*==
This module contains code that creates instances of nominals, verbs, pronouns and other parts of speech.

==Module *syntax*==
Syntax package is a stub only. In future it should contain code that parses whole texts written in Latin.

==Module *tools*==
Various helpers and wrappers that come in use during testing, debugging and showing possibilities and limitations of the code.

==Folder *cgi-bin*==

This folder contains files for local server, which is used to browse the outputs. Forms of words are done on-the-fly and they are not stored in separate file. See _pylatserver.py_ for  more details.

==Folder *vardoc*==

Various files and samples created for debugging/refactoring/documenting the project. The content of the folder is not relevant for the running of the program.
