pyLatinam 0.1.9

Declension, conjugation, analysis and more - Latin language.

PyLatinam is a Python module that grammatically processes Latin language words.
This for now includes declension and conjugation (morphology), with plans to
upgrade code to support more processing, even on syntactic level.

Current status

I am working very little, if anything, on this project - due to the academic
work in another field (English and Serbian phonetics). I hope to be able to
update the code from time to time.
