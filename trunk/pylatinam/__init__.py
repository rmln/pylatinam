"""Latin language - project LATINAM

Declension, conjugation, analysis and more.

This pyLatinam package is several things. The first and the most
important, it is my playgroung for learning Python. Second, it
is a part of much bigger project that could be started in future.

To see some of the thing this program can do, go to tools and
read documentation for out.py.
